  has requested that your email address <$subaddr$> be added
  %iftype normal%
    to the list. This means every time a post is sent to the list, you will
    receive a copy of it.
  %endif%
  %iftype digest%
    to the list, to receive digests. This means you will receive multiple
    posts in a single mail message, at regular intervals, or when a lot of
    posts have accumulated.
  %endif%
  %iftype nomail%
    to the list, without mail delivery. This means you will not receive any
    posts to the list, but you are considered a member. This means, for
    instance, you are able to post to a list which only subscribers may post
    to, while you follow the list using a web archive or another subscribed
    email address.
